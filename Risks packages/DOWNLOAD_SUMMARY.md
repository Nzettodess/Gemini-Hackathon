## Notes

1. **Reference Files:** For non-GitHub URLs (APIs, web services, documentation), a `URL_REFERENCE.txt` file has been created in the tool's folder containing the URL for manual access.

2. **Failed Download:** The "License Checker" tool failed because the repository URL (https://github.com/iweb/scancode-toolkit) does not exist. The correct URL might be different.

3. **Git Repositories:** All successfully cloned repositories were cloned with `--depth 1` to minimize storage space while maintaining access to the latest code.

4. **Usage:** Each tool folder contains the complete repository with documentation, examples, and source code. Refer to individual README files in each tool folder for installation and usage instructions.
